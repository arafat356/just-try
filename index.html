          Bangladesh is a southeast Asian country. It stands on the Bay of
          Bengal, which is on the south and the other three sides are surrounded
          by India. She also shares a little (271 Km.) of the southeast border
          with Myanmar. The population of about 140 million. Most of the people
          speak Bengali, which is the state language. English is seldom spoken.
          There are some tribal languages too. About 85% of the total population
          is Muslim. The rest Hindus, Christens, and Buddhists. People of all
          religions live here peacefully. The 26th March and 16 December are our
          Independence Day and Victory Day respectively. The national dress for
          men is pajama and Punjabi and for women sari and blouse. The informal
          dress for man is a lunge. Our main food is rice, fish, and dal.
          Bangladesh is self-sufficient in food. The largest sea-beach of the
          world in Cox’s Bazar on the southwest coast of the country. Her
          charming beauty is also fascinating. The people of our country are
          very friendly and peace-loving. Every year thousands of tourists visit
          Bangladesh for her natural beauty in a friendly atmosphere.

          Our Country Bangladesh is my motherland. She came into being in 1971.
          Her land area is 1,47,570 square miles. About 16 crore people live
          here. There are sixty-four districts and eight divisions in my
          motherland. The main occupation of the people is agriculture. They
          grow jute, rice, sugarcane, potatoes and various kinds of vegetables
          in plenty. Our mother tongue is Bangla. We speak, write, sing and
          dance in Bangla. Her people are very simple and peace-loving. They are
          patriots too. They love independence. I am proud of being a citizen of
          a country like Bangladesh.

        Education is the backbone of any nation. Education starts from the
        school, and the students learn so much from school. To build a good man
        must have some duties from the school. Bidyaniketan is my school,
        located in Uttara, Dhaka. I learn much from my lovely school. Besides
        the subjective education system, there also have some co-curriculum
        activities. Dance, debating, sports, art, music, etc. are
        extra-curricular systems present in my school. I complete my education
        class 6 to S.S.C. from this school. My school is quite far from home
        living place. Every day I go there by rickshaw or sometimes on foot. The
        relationship between teachers and students is amicable. I also have many
        good school friends.

        My school is so beautiful with its delightful garden, flowers, and
        decoration. Besides the classroom and teachers’ room, there also present
        a well-furnished library room. From subjective to the story, novels each
        type of book are present there. To keep harmony with digitalization also
        has a computer room for the students. Our school teachers are so much
        caring for their students. They give teaching with patience. So that
        each student can catch the lesson, they always try to make ours as a
        real human being. I love my school and my teachers. I give respect and
        greetings to my honorable teachers. Every day I get learning from
        school. That’s why I miss my loveliest school on holidays. As a part of
        my school, I feel proud to share my school memory with others.
